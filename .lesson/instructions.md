# Instructions  

You may not complete this during the lab time, you can come back to it.

Use the slides (on moodle) or [here](https://collegedawson-my.sharepoint.com/personal/pcampbell_dawsoncollege_qc_ca/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpcampbell%5Fdawsoncollege%5Fqc%5Fca%2FDocuments%2F2022%2D360%2Fmoodle%2Dshared%2Ddirectory) and [code examples on github](https://github.com/campbe13/py360-2021/tree/main/lecture-code/02)

1. create an algorithm: think about the problem, create a flowchart or write in point form the steps you will use 
1. use iterative development ___(code a bit, test it, do the next bit...)___
1. use comments for code you want to keep but not remove (ex for debugging)
1. use print statements to see what is in your variables, if you are not sure (ex for debugging)
5. if you do not finish today you can logoff and come back to complete it
1. when you have finished all three you can `submit`   you do not need to submit, do so if you want feedback from me.  (some time next week)

** The coding  instructions are in the main.py file, modify that directly **
